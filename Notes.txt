Create a upsAlarm.service file to start the program at boot:

$ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/upsAlarm.service



[Unit]
Description=UPS Temperature Alarm System
After= graphical.target network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/pi/sendMail
Restart=always
RestartSec=60s
KillMode=process
TimeoutSec=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target



We need to tell systemd to recognize our service, so enter:

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

We then need to tell systemd that we want our service to start on boot:

$ sudo systemctl enable upsAlarm.service
